				<p>On Wednesday, the United Nations Deputy High Commissioner for Refugees, Kelly Clements, called on the private sector for backup. As the 74th U.N. General Assembly continues to meet throughout the week, the need to fill gaps in climate action continues to take center stage.</p>
				 
				<p>“Could you support us?”, Clements asked the audience at the City University of New York’s Graduate Center. The situation in developing countries continues to spiral downwards as an estimated 25 million people become displaced each year due to climate change. </p>

		<p>Clements has been actively advocating for increased support from private stakeholders and academia, claiming there is a need not just for dollars, but ideas, technology, expertise, information sharing and employment for refugees.</p>
