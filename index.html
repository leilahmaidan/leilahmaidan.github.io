<h2>Climate and Migration</h2>

<p>A rapidly Changing world.</p>

<div><img id="girl" src="leilahmaidan.github.io/img/Unknown.jpg">
<p> On Wednesday, the United Nations Deputy High Commissioner for Refugees, Kelly Clements, called on the private sector for backup. As the 74th U.N. General Assembly continues to meet throughout the week, the need to fill gaps in climate action continues to take center stage.</p> 
<p>The meteorological impact of climate change can be divided into two distinct driv- ers of migration; climate processes such as sea-level rise, salinization of agricultural land, desertification and growing water scarcity, and climate events such as flooding, storms and glacial lake outburst floods. But non-climate drivers, such as government policy, population growth and community-level resilience to natural disaster, are also important. All contribute to the degree of vulnerability people experience.</p>
<p>The problem is one of time (the speed of change) and scale (the number of people it will affect). But the simplistic image of a coastal farmer being forced to pack up and move to a rich country is not typical. On the contrary, as is already the case with political refugees, it is likely that the burden of providing for climate migrants will be borne by the poorest countriesâ€”those least responsible for emissions of greenhouse gases.</p>
