<h1 style="color:#FF8C00;"> A chokepoint at Dumbo's F train York St. station </h1>

<p> The rapid population growth witnessed in Dumbo, Brooklyn has placed a strain on the district’s single-station subway system. Residents and city staffers had hoped the F train’s York St. station would be included in an upcoming city project aimed at renovating stations across NYC. Those hopes went down the drain after the location was omitted from the recently released list.   
</p>
<p> The MTA has released a list of 48 of the 70 NYC transit stations that would receive accessibility improvements under the proposed 2020-2024 Capital Plan. The project, which has a $5.5 billion budget, does not include Dumbo’s York St. station. </p>
<p> From 2013 to 2018, the F train’s York St. station has witnessed a 28% increase in daily riders. In 2018, the station saw an average of 11,032 riders a day move through its platform, as opposed to the 8,629 daily commuters recorded back in 2013. 

The York St. station only has one entrance and a very narrow platform. Additionally, it has no
accessibility for strollers or disabled riders. The stations limited capacity could become dangerous in the event of a fire or bomb threat. 
</p> 


<h2 style="color:#FFA500;" >Below is the list of F train stations in Brooklyn that were included for renovations </h2>
 
<ol>
  <li>Avenue I</li>
  <li>Neptune Av</li>
  <li>Kings Hwy</li>
</ol>

<p style="padding-left: 40px; padding-right: 40px"> The graph below demonstrates commuter volume by year for each station selected for renovations relative to the York St. station. The graph demonstrates that the York St. station not only has the highest volume of commuters relative to the other three stations, but that it also witnessed the highest increase in volume in the last six years </p>

<p>In September, Deputy Chief of Staff for Council Member Stephen Levin, Bravo-Lopez Glomani said that the MTA president recently announced they would release a report highlighting 50 stations throughout NYC that would undergo capital projects to make the stations accessible. The councilmember’s office had hoped that the York St. station would be on that list. </p>
<p>"Our office has been in contact with MTA regarding subway entrance issues. We have been working with the Dumbo Action Committee to push and advocate for additional modifications with MTA. However, there are no confirmed plans to upgrade the district’s subway station," said Bravo-Lopez. </p> 
<p>According to the MTA’s press release, the main factors taken into consideration during the selection process included main transfer stations, ridership, and demographics. It also considered costs related to technical and geographic issues that could affect constructability. Additionally, it took into consideration feedback from various communities and customers with disabilities through public meetings, outreach initiatives to community groups and feedback from elected officials. </p>
